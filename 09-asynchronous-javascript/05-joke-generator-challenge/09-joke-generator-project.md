# Joke Generator Project Challenge

We now know how to make a request to an API using the `XMLHttpRequest` object. In this code challenge, we'll use the same technique to make a request to the [https://api.chucknorris.io/](https://api.chucknorris.io/) to get a random Chuck Norris joke and put it into the page. We will also create a button that will allow us to get a new joke.

This code challenge is designed to put into practice what you have learned so far. You just need to do the following:

- Add an event listener for the button
- Create a function that will make a request to https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random using the `XMLHttpRequest` object
- Get the data that is sent back (this.responseText), parse the JSON and get the joke from it
- Display the joke in the page (you can use the `innerHTML` property)
